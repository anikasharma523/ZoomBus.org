Project Title: Bus Booking and Management System
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Motivation: The bus system is currently in disarray, and the data is too cluttered to be easily 
accessed. It makes it difficult to keep track of the number of buses, drivers, and passengers. We have 
designed a web-application that eases out the whole process. Moreover, our web-app displays all 
the statistics on the admin for the improvement of business. 

Code Style: Standard

Tech/Framework used: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Backend: Python â€“ Flask (framework of python), Jinja2 (Dynamic templating language used with 
python)
Database: MySQL 

# How to use
- After downloading the zip file, proceed to open it in a code editor such as VSCode or 
PyCharm.
- The code is divided into a style solder: containing all our css files, a template folder 
containing the various templates used and a main app.py file to run.
- Tables for the database need to be created before running the application on the system.
- Command to run in terminal: python app.py

# Features:
1. Admin side: 
- User authentication
- Adding a driver
- Adding a bus
- Deleting a driver
- Deleting a bus
- Viewing the statistics over the years
2. User Side:
- User authentication
- Searching for a bus based on source and destination
- Booking a bus 
- Viewing past bookings
- Cancellation of booked bus

Novelty Feature: 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enhance the existing bus reservation system by implementing descriptive data analysis capabilities for the administrator. This will involve examining the revenue generated in the previous periods and identifying the most popular bus and route based on customer demand.
